# d3-map-change-demo
Demo of mapping change over time using d3.js: change in population density, by state, for each decade between 1790 and 2010.

This demo requires the following external libraries:
  1. d3.js version 6.3.1, loaded from a CDN
  2. jquery version 1.11.1, loaded from a CDN
  3. colorbrewer.js, loaded from colorbrewer2.org

This demo was presented at April 3, 2015 CommGIS meeting and at MassIT on April 24, 2015.
At that time, the demo used D3 version 3.5.17. It was migrated to D3 version 6.3.1 on January 7, 2021.  

The careful viewer will notice some \(at least somewhat\) surprising things,
for example: Vermont was enumerated by the census before it was admitted to the union!
